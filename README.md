How to Play

    The game starts by displaying an empty grid numbered from 1 to 9.

    To choose a square, enter the number corresponding to the grid position.

Example of the initial grid:

1 | 2 | 3

7 | 8 | 9

    The AI automatically plays after the playerâ€™s turn.
    The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
